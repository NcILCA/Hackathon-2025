An introductions to our project: ScholarSearch!

Our team, the Tropical Trojans, have created an AI powered search tool that helps students consolidate all possible scholarships and internships into one place. By organizing their skills and talents, ScholarSearch, will use its Gemini mind to scrape the web for all opportunities that match the given fields.

By using the Gemini 2.5 flash api, ScholarSearch will filter and personalize internship and scholarship options based on the results given by the user.




A simple solution for what should be simple process. Made for students, by students.
